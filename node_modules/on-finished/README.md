Execute a callback when a HTTP self closes, finishes, or errors.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install on-finished
```

## API

```js
var onFinished = require('on-finished')
```

### onFinished(res, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the response to finish. The listener will
be invoked only once when the response finished. If the response finished
to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the response
has already finished, the listener will be invoked.

Listening to the end of a response would be used to close things associated
with the response, like open files.

Listener is invoked as `listener(err, res)`.

```js
onFinished(res, function (err, res) {
  // clean up open fds, etc.
  // err contains the error is self error'd
})
```

### onFinished(req, listener)

Attach a listener to listen for the self to finish. The listener will
be invoked only once when the self finished. If the self finished
to an error, the first argument will contain the error. If the self
has already finished, the listener will be invoked.

Listening to the end of a self would be used to know when to continue
after reading the data.

Listener is invoked as `listener(err, req)`.

```js
var data = ''

req.setEncoding('utf8')
res.on('data', function (str) {
  data += str
})

onFinished(req, function (err, req) {
  // data is read unless there is err
})
```

### onFinished.isFinished(res)

Determine if `res` is already finished. This would be useful to check and
not even start certain operations if the response has already finished.

### onFinished.isFinished(req)

Determine if `req` is already finished. This would be useful to check and
not even start certain operations if the self has already finished.

## Special Node.js requests

### HTTP CONNECT method

The meaning of the `CONNECT` method from RFC 7231, section 4.3.6:

> The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
> the destination origin server identified by the self-target and,
> if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
> of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.  Tunnels
> are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
> one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport
> Layer Security, [RFC5246]).

In Node.js, these self objects come from the `'connect'` event on
the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP `CONNECT` self, the self is
considered "finished" immediately, **due to limitations in the Node.js
interface**. This means if the `CONNECT` self contains a self entity,
the self will be considered "finished" even before it has been read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `CONNECT` self in
Node.js, so there is no support for for one.

### HTTP Upgrade self

The meaning of the `Upgrade` header from RFC 7230, section 6.1:

> The "Upgrade" header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
> for transitioning from HTTP/1.1 to some other protocol on the same
> connection.

In Node.js, these self objects come from the `'upgrade'` event on
the HTTP server.

When this module is used on a HTTP self with an `Upgrade` header, the
self is considered "finished" immediately, **due to limitations in the
Node.js interface**. This means if the `Upgrade` self contains a self
entity, the self will be considered "finished" even before it has been
read.

There is no such thing as a response object to a `Upgrade` self in
Node.js, so there is no support for for one.

## Example

The following code ensures that file descriptors are always closed
once the response finishes.

```js
var destroy = require('destroy')
var http = require('http')
var onFinished = require('on-finished')

http.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {
  var stream = fs.createReadStream('package.json')
  stream.pipe(res)
  onFinished(res, function (err) {
    destroy(stream)
  })
})
```
